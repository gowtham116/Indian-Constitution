 <h4>Special procedure for enactment of certain laws relating to language.</h4>
 
 <p>
 During the period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, no Bill or amendment making provision for the language to be used for any of the purposes mentioned in clause (1) of article 348 shall be introduced or moved in either House of Parliament without the previous sanction of the President, and the President shall not give his sanction to the introduction of any such Bill or the moving of any such amendment except after he has taken into consideration the recommendations of the Commission constituted under clause (1) of article 344 and the report of the Committee constituted under clause (4) of that article.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 (Article 349 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution 1948. A Drafting Committee Member introduced this provision on 12 September 1949.  

 

The Draft Article stated that for 15 years from the commencement of the Constitution, Parliament cannot pass a Bill that requires the use of a specific language in court and parliamentary documents. It can only do so after the President considers the report of the Language Committee and provides his/her sanction for such a Bill.  

 

There were no discussions or amendments to the Draft Article and it was added to the Constitution on 14 September, 1949.
