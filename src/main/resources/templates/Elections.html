Debate Summary
Draft Article 289A (Article 325 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution 1948. The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced this provision on 16 June 1949. The Draft Article stated that there would be only one electoral roll for each constituency for election to Parliament and State legislatures. It also stated that no person would be excluded from the rolls on account of religion, race, caste, or sex.

  

The objective behind the provision, the Drafting Committee Chairman said, was to categorically state that there would be no separate electorates for minorities.  

 

Draft Article 289A was adopted on the same day without debate.

Debate Summary
Draft Article 289B (Article 326 of Constitution of India 1950) was absent in the Draft Constitution 1948. <br>The Drafting Committee Chairman introduced this provision on 16 June 1949. It unequivocally declared that elections to legislatures would be based on universal adult suffrage.  

 

A Member opposed this Draft Article stating that adult franchise was not theoretically or practically possible. He believed that the Article ‘violated the tenets of demcracy’ and implied that the Indian electorate was not elightened, and parliamentary democracy in India would fail.  

 
<br>
The President reminded the Member that the Draft Article was merely restating a princple that the Assembly had already accepted. There was no further deabte and the Assembly adopted the Draft Article.

 
Draft Article 289B was adopted on the same day without further debate.

Draft Article 290, Draft Constitution of India (1948) 

Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the Legislature of a State for the time being specified in Part I of the First Schedule may, from time to time, by law, make provision with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections to the House or Houses of the Legislature of the State including matters necessary for securing the due constitution of such House or Houses and the delimitation of constituencies. 
<br><br>
 

Draft Article 291 (Article 3 28, Constitution of India 1950) was discussed on 16 June 1949. The Draft Article gave the State Legislatures the power to make provisions with respect to elections to the State Legislature(s) and delimit constituencies.    
<br><br>
 

The Drafting Committee Chairman moved an amendment which would allow the State Legislature to make provisions on matters related to elections only if the Parliament had not already done so. He moved another amendment to change the powers of the Parliament to include preparation of electoral rolls and all other necessary matters.    
<br><br>
 

A member was concerned that the Draft Article could create ‘some sort of friction or tension between the Parliament and the State Legislature...’ The Drafting Chairman clarified that the State Legislature would only have residuary powers and that it could only make provisions on matters that the Parliament had failed to make provisions on. 
<br><br>
 

Both the amendments were accepted by the Assembly without any debate.

The amended Draft Article was adopted into the Constitution on the same day.
