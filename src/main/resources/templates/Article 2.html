<h4>Article 2, Draft Constitution, 1948</h4>
<p>
Parliament may, from time to time, by law admit into the Union, or establish, new States on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.
<br>
<br>
Draft Article 2 (Article 2) was debated on 5th November 1948 and 17th November 1948. 
It empowered the Parliament to make laws to admit or establish states to the Union.
<br>
<br>
One member believed that State should be clearly defined in order to ensure uniform interpretation in the Constitution. 
He argued that the Draft Constitution in its current form uses state indiscriminately in myriad forms. However, State must be defined to always connote a kind of sovereignty. 
He proposed to retain old expressions such as Provinces, Indian States and Chief Commissioners Provinces.
<br>
<br>
A member argued that Draft Articles 2 and 3 overlap and moved a proposal to substitute them with a single Article. 
He opined that the purpose of Draft Article 2 was achieved by Draft Article 3 (Article 3), and having two separate Articles was redundant.
However, his amendment was not accepted.    
<br>
<br>
The Assembly adopted Draft Article 2 without amendments on 17th November 1948.
